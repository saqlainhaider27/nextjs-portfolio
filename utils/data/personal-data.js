  description: "Hi, I'm Saqlain Haider. I'm a Unity Developer based in Pakistan. With more than 3 years of hands-on experience in game development in Unity with C#, I have developed diverse self-initiated projects that demonstrate my enthusiasm for game-based experiences and gameplay systems. My background in graphics programming is solid, and I keep broadening my horizon by learning about low-level rendering APIs like OpenGL and DirectX. My areas of interest include creating immersive games, performance optimization, and ongoing learning to explore the limits of real-time graphics and interactivity.",
